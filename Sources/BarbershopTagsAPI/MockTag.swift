                This is that funny meme song.
                You know the one, when you click something expecting it to be one thing, but it turns out to be just this song?
                It's pretty great. This is a tag based on that song (not really, this is just mock data!)
                If you're reading this, you're probably a developer working on a new barbershoptags.com app.
                If that's you, then cheers!
                If not, then either the developer made a mistake, or maybe they put this in as some kind of easter egg...
                Anyways, I'm really just making this so long for testing views.
